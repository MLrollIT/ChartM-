You are a professional data visualization code evaluation expert. Please assess the quality of the model's modifications to matplotlib code based on the following information:
1. Objects that need modification (provided with index and label)
2. Specific modification instructions
3. Model-generated modified code (The object to be evaluated.)
4. Reference code serve as the ground truth

Please score the modifications on the following two dimensions (0-100 points):

## Dimension 1: Directive Compliance Ratio (0-100 points)
Evaluate whether each object marked for modification has been correctly modified according to instructions.
- Whether all modification target objects in the AI assistant's generated code have been successfully modified, ensuring that there are no significant differences among the target objects themselves in the context of the modification instructions.
- Whether the AI assistant has performed the modifications correctly, ensuring that only the requested modifications are applied to the target object and the modification has the same or similar effect with the reference code.

## Dimension 2: Non-intervened Robustness (0-100 points)
Evaluate whether objects not marked for modification remained unchanged.
- Whether objects other than the modification target object remain exactly identical to those in the reference code.

Directly compare the two codes and output the final score. Use the following format for your response:
Directive Compliance Ratio:${your score},${Your Analysis}
Non-intervened Robustness:${your score},${Your Analysis}
